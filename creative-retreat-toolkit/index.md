A few years ago I was working an unfulfilling nine-to-five job. I knew I wanted to transition into a more creative career, but didn‚Äôt know where to start. I was creatively blocked and felt completely stuck!

Instead of quitting my job without a plan, I started brainstorming creative project ideas that I could work on outside of my nine-to-five. The only goal with these projects was to experiment and learn more about myself and the type of work I‚Äôd like to be doing.

But working on creative passion projects outside my main source of income was challenging. I was oftentimes too tired to work on anything creative after work and the idea of waking up any earlier in the morning made me want to cry.

> By creating a simple project management system that worked for me, I ended up building a portfolio that allowed me to transition into a fulfilling creative career as a designer and software developer. Yes, my creative passion projects completely changed my life, and I want you to feel the same joy and excitement I did when I finally landed my first job as a professional creative.

You‚Äôre going to learn my step-by-step process for executing your very own Creative Retreat that will help you build a portfolio of work that demonstrates your passion, skill, and strength as a creative.

I‚Äôm not saying that every weekend should be spent working on your creative passion projects. (In fact, I‚Äôm a huge advocate for working sustainably, mindfully, and taking care of ourselves to avoid burnout.) But I find that carving out large chunks of time (aka one full weekend for your very own Creative Retreat) every few months to make something fun and meaningful is exactly what the doctor ordered.

## The Creative Retreat Toolkit is a an online course that will help you create more time, space, and accountability to work on your creative side project and make huge leaps of progress in one weekend.

Inside the course, you‚Äôll learn:

- How to brainstorm and narrow down project ideas to select the one that is most meaningful and important to work on right now.
- Why spending a full weekend working on your creative passion projects is your secret weapon to building a life and career you love.
- The value of utilizing a simple one-page project plan to keep you on track to actually finishing your creative projects (template included).

## About me, the creator of the Creative Retreat Toolkit

Hi! I‚Äôm Samantha Andrews, and I used to feel completely overwhelmed by the number of creative passion projects I had started but never finished.

Like you, I spend most of my energy working a nine-to-five job. But I also have tons of creative ideas that I want to bring to life. Instead of waiting for ‚Äúsomeday‚Äù to work on my creative passion projects, I use a simple project management system that leverages the time I have available ‚Äî the weekend.

I‚Äôve used the exact system outlined in The Creative Retreat Toolkit since 2016 and launched over ten meaningful and fulfilling creative passion [projects]({{ "/projects" }}). In 2018, I leveraged my portfolio of passion projects into a career as a designer and software developer (while also doubling my previous income üòÆ). I remember the feeling of accomplishment and fulfillment knowing that I had taken the time to work on my craft and that it had paid off. No advanced degree required! I want you to experience that same feeling through the use of the Creative Retreat Toolkit.
