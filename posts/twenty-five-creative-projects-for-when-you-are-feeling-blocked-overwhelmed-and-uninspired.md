Write a “Choose Your Own Adventure” story.

Write your own [artist manifesto or prayer](https://juliacameronlive.com/2012/01/26/a-powerful-prayer/).

Start a [One Second Everyday](https://1se.co/) film.

Collect stones from outside and paint faces on them.

Write down the most important events in your life and create a timeline with magazine and newspaper clippings.

[Write a poem](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-write-a-poem/).

Build a one-page website using free, no-code tools such as [Carrd](https://carrd.co/)

Fun-a-day project. Challenge yourself to complete one small creative act every day for one month. For example, send one postcard every day for a month, take one photo of a different basketball hoop each day of the month, etc.

100 day challenge. Similar to the fun-a-day project, but longer. A few years back I did my own 100 day challenge when I was teaching myself Adobe Illustrator. It was called 100 Cats in 100 Days and it was exactly as you’d expect. Due to the length of this project, I recommend you pick a topic/format that is sustainable. You should be able to complete your daily project in about 30 minutes or less.

Make a self-portrait using some of your childhood arts and crafts supplies. Crayons, markers, Play Doh, Spirograph, etc.

Make a self-portrait using items from your garbage.

Make a sculpture using items from your recycling.

Give yourself \$5 and take a trip to the Dollar Store. Make a piece of art out of the things you purchased.

Create a protest poster.

Start a [guerilla art](http://www.kerismith.com/popular-posts/how-to-be-a-guerilla-artist-2/) project.

Make a sidewalk chalk mural.

Make a one-page zine.

Write a screenplay using one of your favorite books as a starting point.

Make a drawing using Microsoft Paint.

Make a piece of art using Excel, Sheets, or Google Sheets.

Join the online [Obstructions.work](http://obstructions.work/) workshop and utilize creative constraints to try something new.

Open [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/) and take screenshots of your favorite places in the world. Make an ebook out of the resulting images.

Create a travel guide for your hometown or favorite city.

Draw a map of your city from memory.

[Make your own journal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu4hEQf64GY) using paper, card stock, string, and a pin (or a hammer and a nail).

Remember, you are creative! Start small. Tiny projects are just as good as big, complicated ones.
