1. Write a “Choose Your Own Adventure” story.
2. Write your own [artist manifesto or prayer](https://juliacameronlive.com/2012/01/26/a-powerful-prayer/).
3. Start a [One Second Everyday](https://1se.co/) film.
4. Collect stones from outside and paint faces on them.
5. Write down the most important events in your life and create a timeline with magazine and newspaper clippings.
6. [Write a poem](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-write-a-poem/).
7. Build a one-page website using free, no-code tools such as [Carrd](https://carrd.co/)
8. Fun-a-day project. Challenge yourself to complete one small creative act every day for one month. For example, send one postcard every day for a month, take one photo of a different basketball hoop each day of the month, etc.
9. 100 day challenge. Similar to the fun-a-day project, but longer. A few years back I did my own 100 day challenge when I was teaching myself Adobe Illustrator. It was called 100 Cats in 100 Days and it was exactly as you’d expect. Due to the length of this project, I recommend you pick a topic/format that is sustainable. You should be able to complete your daily project in about 30 minutes or less.
10. Make a self-portrait using some of your childhood arts and crafts supplies. Crayons, markers, Play Doh, Spirograph, etc.
11. Make a self-portrait using items from your garbage.
12. Make a sculpture using items from your recycling.
13. Give yourself $5 and take a trip to the Dollar Store. Make a piece of art out of the things you purchased.
14. Create a protest poster.
15. Start a [guerilla art](http://www.kerismith.com/popular-posts/how-to-be-a-guerilla-artist-2/) project.
16. Make a sidewalk chalk mural.
17. Make a one-page zine.
18. Write a screenplay using one of your favorite books as a starting point.
19. Make a drawing using Microsoft Paint.
20. Make a piece of art using Excel, Sheets, or Google Sheets.
21. Join the online [Obstructions.work](http://obstructions.work/) workshop and utilize creative constraints to try something new.
22. Open [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/) and take screenshots of your favorite places in the world. Make an ebook out of the resulting images.
23. Create a travel guide for your hometown or favorite city.
24. Draw a map of your city from memory.
25. [Make your own journal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu4hEQf64GY) using paper, card stock, string, and a pin (or a hammer and a nail).
26. Remember, you are creative! Start small. Tiny projects are just as good as big, complicated ones.
