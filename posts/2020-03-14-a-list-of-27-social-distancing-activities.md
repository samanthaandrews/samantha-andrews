These times feel uncertain and scary. I’m worried about my aging grandparents and worried that this level of anxiety will become the new normal.

One thing I’ve learned in the past week is how social distancing helps slow down the spread of a highly contagious disease. Slowing the spread means healthcare facilities are less likely to become overwhelmed, which means they’ll be able to adequately care for people who need it. And while staying home or away from social gatherings feels extreme or uncomfortable, we know it works, which gives me hope.

If you’re practicing some form of social distancing this weekend, here are some questions that might help you see the silver lining during this uncertain time. Get out a journal or pen & paper and write down your answers! Make a list! Get those pencils moving!

- How can I use this time to bring myself closer to friends and family? (maybe not _physically_ closer, but emotionally, perhaps?)
- How can I use this time to think more deeply about my priorities and intentions for the coming months?

As an introvert, social distancing isn’t out of my comfort zone. I find that by spending time alone I can find the clarity and peace I need to move about my day. Here is a list of activities that I enjoy doing alone. Take what you need and feel free to share.

1. Write a letter
2. Cook something with food already in your cupboards (DIY Chopped challenge!)
3. Declutter your closet (or kitchen or garage or bathroom!)

If you are healthy and fortunate enough to work from home and/or still collect a paycheck during this time, here are some ways to help others in your community:

- Donate food or money to your local food bank
- Donate to a local creative space
- Buy gift cards to places you regularly frequent but won’t be visiting in the next few days, like coffee shops, restaurants, and gift shops
- Continue to pay for cleaning services or gym memberships even if you won’t be utilizing them for a while
- Offer to pick up groceries/supplies for vulnerable neighbors and family members
- Offer to babysit for folks who have to go in to work
- Spread the word about services and resources that are being offered in your community

Stay safe & take care of each other, friends!

Here's a collage I made today as part of my social isolation. Featuring clippings from Oprah magazine.
