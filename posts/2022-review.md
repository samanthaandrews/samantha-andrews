I love a yearly review. This year in list format because my brain couldn't handle paragraphs. I'm sure you understand.

- Sometimes setting your life on fire is the answer. This year I moved across the country, deleted my Instagram and Twitter accounts, and started taking art classes in a new city. I was in a rut and moving away from everything familiar was the fastest way to reinvent myself.
- I need hours of uninterruped time in order to get into a creative focused state. Meetings kill the vibe.
- I feel most like myself when I’m making art & when I’m dancing.
- One of my favorite ways to travel is by visiting a friend’s hometown. This summer I met up with a friend who grew up in Buffalo. I loved meeting her family, eating at their favorite restaurants, and doing random suburban things. This is way more fun for me than visiting somewhere completely unfamiliar.
- Birthdays can be hard. Going out of town makes it way more enjoyable. (Hayley Nahman wrote about this somewhere in her [newsletter](https://haleynahman.substack.com/archive) but I can't find the exact post.)
- Having house guests is lovely, but I need to figure out better ways to ensure I’m getting enough alone time/down time when we have visitors.
- The two best purchases of the year: (1) This [sonicare electric toothbrush](https://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/HX9914_82/diamondclean-9000-sonic-electric-toothbrush-with-app) and (2) This [dyson vacuum](https://www.dyson.com/vacuum-cleaners/cordless/v8/absolute/silver-nickel).
- I feel better when I do some sort of movement every day. 20 minutes of yoga or a walk are enough. Going to the gym is better.
- I’m very good at keeping a home. Sunday cooking and cleaning are my favorite weekly rituals.
- Big, lofty goals are great, but more important are consitent practice and tender discipline.
- I’ve wasted too much of my life forcing myself to do things I don’t want to do. I’m currently exploring what happens if I stop this habit and do whatever I want instead. These are the questions that are guiding me:
    - What do I need to feel right now?
    - How can my art be in service to that feeling?
    - Where can I find flow?
- Diet has a much bigger impact on my nervous system than I wanted to believe. Quitting caffeine and cutting back on dairy and sugar while eating more protein, fiber, and electrolytes has greatly improved my day-to-day functioning and mood.
- Coaches and teachers are the key to staying on a creative and intentional path. I’m currently receiving leadership coaching from [Lindsay Parker](https://www.connectedwisdom.ca/). [Martha Bloom](https://www.newyorkschoolofthearts.org/faculty1/2017/12/2/martha-bloom) is my printmaking teacher. They’re my real-life fairy godmothers.
- One year oftentimes isn’t enough time to see progress. But looking back three to five years, I can see how I’ve grown leaps and bounds. Four years ago I would have struggled to cook dinner for friends, but now I do it almost weekly and I’m usually proud of the food I put on the table.

## 2023 Goals
1. Build an artistic practice
2. Productive mornings
3. Share & make friends online
4. Make my partner feel special & loved
5. Practice wholehearted leadership

I've started using Complice to track my goals, and I've made them [public](https://complice.co/samandrews/goals). If you're interested, click that link and you can read a longer description of each one.
