# Gradient Mesh

## A newsletter for artists, makers, and busy professionals who want to create their own artistic practice

Iâ€™m Samantha Andrews, a software engineer and designer interested in exploring what it means to build an artistic ðŸŽ¨ and multi-passionate âœ¨ career.

Gradient Mesh is my weekly newsletter that arrives in your inbox on Sunday mornings.

Hereâ€™s what you can expect:

- Writing about my journey to becoming a full-time multi-passionate artist & maker
- Advice on how to get organized and better manage your time and energy to prioritize your creative practice
- Notion templates
- Thoughtful (and sometimes weird) recommendations
