<h1><span class="gradient__text">Gradient Mesh</span></h1>

## A newsletter for artists, makers, and busy professionals who want to pave their own path and start making art

I’m Samantha Andrews, an artist and software engineer exploring what it means to build an ꩜ artistic and ✷ multi-passionate career.

Gradient Mesh is my newsletter that arrives in your inbox whenever I post a new studio vlog on [YouTube]({{ metadata.youtube }}). This is when I have the most to say about what I'm learning about building an artistic practice. I usually send one or two newsletters each month.

Here’s what you can expect:

- Writing about my journey through my DIY art school curriculum
- Advice on how to get organized and better manage your time and energy to prioritize your creative practice
- Notion templates
- Thoughtful (and sometimes weird) recommendations

  You can also view previous issues in the [archive](https://buttondown.email/samantha-andrews/archive), and subscribe via [RSS](https://buttondown.email/samantha-andrews/rss)!
