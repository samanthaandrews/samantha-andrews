I use a few different tools to keep me organized and productive as I work on creative projects. Below are some that I recommend.

Some of the links on this page are affiliate links and if you use them I get a small commission (at no extra cost to you).

Have a tool or product you think I should know about? Send me an email at [samanthaspaghetti@gmail.com](mailto:samanthaspaghetti@gmail.com) or tweet me [@samspaghettiii](https://twitter.com/samspaghettiii).

## Project management, organization, and business stuff

### [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=b9b8d2c6857340a89190ea283e49ee3d)

Free to start! \$4/month for Personal

I use Notion for brainstorming, note-taking, and dumping all sorts of inspirational content I find across the web. It’s like a beautifully-designed database for your life.

### [Teux Deux](https://teuxdeux.com/)

\$2/month paid yearly

This is a simple to-do app created by Tina Roth Eisenberg, aka Swiss Miss. I love that TeuxDeux allows me to see my full week laid out, with space for additional lists at the bottom (It’s where I put my bucket list!).

![google photos logo](https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/google-photos.svg)

### [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/)

Free!

When iCloud Photo Storage got too complicated (there were so many backups!?) I switched to Google Photos. It’s free and easy to create and share photo albums.

![google drive logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Google_Drive_logo.png/600px-Google_Drive_logo.png)

### [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)

Free to start! \$2/month for 100 GB storage

I use Google Drive for all of my cloud storage. It's nice to have everything in one place across devices.

### [Dashlane Password Manager](https://www.dashlane.com/cs/hZBZyDpTSAG7)

Free to start! \$4.99/month for Premium

Do you use a password manager? If you don’t, you definitely should! I like Dashlane Premium because it allows me to manage unlimited passwords on unlimited devices, plus Dark Web Monitoring and secure VPN.

![buttondown email logo](https://buttondown.email/static/images/icons/icon@400.png)

### [Buttondown Email](https://buttondown.email/)

Free for your first thousand customers! \$5/thousand subscribers per month after that

When Mailchimp became a chore to use, I switched to Buttondown, a small, elegant tool for producing newsletters.

![netlify logo](https://www.netlify.com/img/press/logos/logomark.png)

### [Netlify Web Hosting](https://www.netlify.com/)

Free to start!

I build and host this website with Netlify. It's fast, easy, and free to get started. I love the flexibility that Netflix provides.

![eleventy logo](https://d2eip9sf3oo6c2.cloudfront.net/tags/images/000/001/284/full/11ty.png)

### [Eleventy Static Website Generator](https://www.11ty.dev/)

Free!

If you're a developer, I highly recommend trying Eleventy for your next static site. It's not as opinionated as Gatsby which I find refreshing.

## Learning

### [Creative Live](https://www.creativelive.com/)

When I want to learn something new, Creative Live is the first place I look. Their online courses are professional, beautifully curated, and easy to follow. I highly recommend [A Brand Called You](https://www.creativelive.com/class/a-brand-called-you-debbie-millman) by Debbie Millman.

![libby logo](https://resources.overdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/libby-icon.png)

### [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/)

Free with a libary card!

Stop paying so much for books when you can read them (or listen to them!) for free on your phone.
