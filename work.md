# Work

I’m a software engineer with 7+ years of experience building and shipping products. I’ve worked in large nonprofits and small start-up environments. As a former visual designer, I enjoy bringing Figma designs to life through scalable, maintainable code and accessible UX.

## Current Projects

## New York Public Library

### Open eBooks Hybrid Mobile Apps

## Descartes Labs

### Viewer Web App for Viewing and Analyzing Geospatial Data

### Jupyter Notebook Widgets

## Earlier Work & Creative Projects (2016-2020)

Before transitioning fully into professional software engineering, I designed brands and websites, made zines, and taught workshops about design & code.
