**I’m a designer, web developer, and multimedia artist based in Albuquerque, New Mexico.** My work generally involves closely examining my relationship with technology and re-imagining what the internet could be if we made it a more equitable space for art and exploration instead of another facet of the capitalist machine.

Drowning in listicles about how to be more productive, how to build better habits, and how to achieve inbox zero, I started asking myself: What if we wrote poetry in GoogleSheets? What if the internet was free for everyone, everywhere? And how can we make more apps and websites that delight and amaze?

I am compelled by the ways in which we use technology to write poetry, deepen our capacity for empathy, and strengthen local communities.

## My Story

I graduated from the University of New Mexico in 2014 with a Communication degree and wrote my first line of code in 2018. For the past two years I’ve worked as a visual designer and front-end developer at [Descartes Labs](https://www.descarteslabs.com/), a platform for geospatial data analysis.

As a 90s kid, I grew up playing PC games like Zoo Tycoon and the Sims. The internet didn’t exist in my home until I was 12 years old, when my parents got dial-up and I was granted an hour a day to chat with my friends via AOL Instant Messenger.

Since then, I’ve formed a love/hate relationship with technology, especially the internet. I hate losing myself in the Instagram vortex and the way most of my experiences online feel like walking around a suburban shopping mall. I love finding weird, whimsical apps and websites and learning more about the people who make them.

I believe in building interesting and unexpected digital experiences and that it is much more fun to blur the lines between design and engineering.
