I am a ✨designer, 💻programmer, and ✏️writer based in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

While working a full-time job as a designer and software developer, I’ve built a consistent creative practice and launched several side projects. Now, I'm sharing what I've learned about **burnout, nurturing your inner artist, and building creative projects with joy and intention**.

## My Story

In 2014 I graduated with a bachelor's degree and started providing freelance graphic design services and writing about minimialism. I also played music with an all-ladies punk band and reignited my childhood passion for creativity through zine-making. Several years later, I completed a software development bootcamp and started writing code for a geospatial data startup.

In 2019 I struggled through a tough period of burnout. As an ambitious overachiever, I had reached my limit. I started asking myself the hard question: Who am I without all the **_doing_**?

I read Julia Cameron's _The Artist’s Way_ and started writing Morning Pages. This blog and website was born from the healing and clarity that came from building a consistent creative practice.

I believe my purpose is to nourish myself and others with love, truth, beauty, creativity, and laughter. I also know that you (yes, you!) are an abundantly creative individual and that the world needs your art.

Thank you for being here.

Now let’s get back to testing spaghetti recipes, shall we?
