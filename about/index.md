**I’m a designer, software developer, and writer based in Albuquerque, New Mexico.** I graduated from the University of New Mexico in 2014 and completed a full stack software development bootcamp in 2018.

For the past two years I’ve worked as a visual designer and front-end developer at [Descartes Labs](https://www.descarteslabs.com/), a platform for geospatial data analysis. Together we built a Jupyter extension that allows data scientists to visualize, analyze, and share large amounts of satellite imagery in the browser.

Now I am looking for a new adventure as a creative educator or developer at a digital product agency. I am eager to take up a challenge that will help me grow as a technical problem-solver and deepen my understanding of modern web development.

I believe in building purposeful products, that constraints are key, and that it is much more fun to blur the lines between design and engineering.

I’m also a creative coach for busy professionals struggling with burnout.

While working a full-time job as a designer and software developer, I’ve built a consistent creative practice and launched several side projects. Now, I'm sharing what I've learned about **burnout**, **nurturing your inner artist**, and **building creative projects with joy and intention**.

## You're in the right place if…

- You feel **_overwhelmed_** and **_uninspired_** by the busy cycle of everyday life
- You’re tired of trying to optimize every aspect of your life through productivity hacks
- You want to have more **_space_** and **_time_** to focus on building an intentional creative practice that brings **_meaning_** and **_joy_** to your day
- You have multiple creative project ideas but struggle to actually **_finish_** any of them

I believe my purpose is to nourish myself and others with love, truth, creativity, and laughter. I also know that you (yes, you!) are an abundantly creative individual and that the world needs your art.

Thank you for being here.

Now let’s get back to testing spaghetti recipes, shall we?
