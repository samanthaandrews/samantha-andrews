I am a ‚ú®designer, üíªprogrammer, and ‚úèÔ∏èwriter based in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

While working a full-time job as a designer and software developer, I‚Äôve built a consistent creative practice and launched several¬†side projects.¬†Now, I'm sharing what I've learned about **burnout, nurturing your inner artist, and building creative projects with joy and intention**.

## You're in the right place if‚Ä¶

- You feel **_overwhelmed_** and **_uninspired_** by the busy cycle of everyday life
- You‚Äôre tired of trying to optimize every aspect of your life through productivity hacks
- You want to have more **_space_** and **_time_** to focus on building an intentional creative practice that brings **_meaning_** and **_joy_** to your day
- You have multiple creative project ideas but struggle to actually **_finish_** any of them

## My Story

In 2014 I graduated with a bachelor's degree and started providing freelance graphic design services and writing about minimialism. I also played music with an all-ladies punk band and reignited my childhood passion for creativity through zine-making. Several years later, I completed a software development bootcamp and started writing code for a geospatial data startup.

In 2019 I struggled through a tough period of burnout. As an ambitious overachiever, I had reached my limit. I started asking myself the hard question: Who am I without all the **_doing_**?

I read Julia Cameron's _The Artist‚Äôs Way_ and started writing Morning Pages. This blog and website was born from the healing and clarity that came from building a consistent creative practice.

I believe my purpose is to nourish myself and others with love, truth, beauty, creativity, and laughter. I also know that you (yes, you!) are an abundantly creative individual and that the world needs your art.

Thank you for being here.
