I am a multi-media artist, programmer, and writer based in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

In 2014 I graduated with a BA in Communication from the University of New Mexico. Several years later, I completed a software development bootcamp and started writing code for a geospatial data startup. During the in-between years I played music with an all-ladies punk band and reignited my childhood passion for creativity through zine-making.

Last year I struggled through a tough period of burnout. As an ambitious overachiever, I had reached my limit. I started asking myself the hard question: Who am I without all the **_doing_**?

I read Julia Cameron's _The Artist’s Way_ and started writing Morning Pages. This blog and website was born from the healing and clarity that came from building a consistent creative practice.

I believe my purpose on this planet is to nourish myself and others with love, truth, beauty, creativity, and laughter. Thank you for being here.

Now let’s get back to testing spaghetti recipes, shall we?
