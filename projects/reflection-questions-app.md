description: "A repository of reflection questions and journaling prompts"
longDescription: "I experienced the power of thoughtful reflection during my freshman year of college when a professor required every student keep a journal. Each week I wrote my thoughts in response to an assigned set of reading questions. These prompts gave me the space to question existing beliefs and strengthen my critical thinking skills. I decided to publish my growing list of reflection questions and prompts as a web app and share the power of journaling with the world. Included in this repository are over 400 prompts from Dr. V.B. Price at the University of New Mexico."
