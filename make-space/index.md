# Decluttering & Organizing Services for Big Life Transitions in NYC

## Simplify your life ✷ Make space for what matters

Hi, I’m Sam, a professional organizer specializing in big life changes — (1) growing your family and (2) preparing for death.

I believe that the process of decluttering and organizing is a spiritual one. By changing up our environment we make room for fresh, clean energy to circulate, and new perspectives along with it.

With a personalized touch and one-on-one attention, I’m committed to helping you navigate big life transitions with grace. Let’s transform your space together, making room for new beginnings and endings.
