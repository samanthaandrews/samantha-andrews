I’m currently exploring what it means to build a meaningful life and sustainable career while working through burnout and perfectionism. Day-by-day I’m building an [artistic practice]({{ metadata.etsy }}), following my curiosity, and finding the best dinner party recipes.

One of my strengths is decluttering and organizing messy spaces to make them more open and inviting. Fill out this [form](/make-space) if you’re interested in hiring me to re-imagine your space (NYC-area only).

The best way to find me is on [Twitter]({{ metadata.twitter }}), [YouTube]({{ metadata.youtube }}), or through my monthly newsletter—Gradient Mesh—where I publish writing and videos for multi-passionate people who want to build a centered and spacious creative practice and prioritize work that matters.
