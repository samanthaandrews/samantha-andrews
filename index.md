Drowning in listicles about how to be more productive, how to build better habits, and how to achieve inbox zero, I started asking myself: What if we wrote poetry in GoogleSheets? What if the internet was free for everyone, everywhere? And how can we make more apps and websites that delight and amaze?

I am compelled by the ways in which we use design and technology to write poetry, deepen our capacity for empathy, and strengthen local communities.

I see life as a practice. I'm currently practicing writing 750 words every day, doing cartwheels (badly), and identifying birds. I try not to take myself too seriously.

Previously, I taught computer programming to girls ages 11-18 with [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/).

I make money by working as a visual designer and front-end developer at [Descartes Labs](https://www.descarteslabs.com/). I'm also a freelance designer and web developer for purpose-driven businesses and nonprofits in the Southwest. There's nothing I love more than designing brands and building websites that help people connect with their community and make their ideas come to life.

I'm currently open for freelance projects. Check out my [services](/services) and [get in touch](/hire-me).
