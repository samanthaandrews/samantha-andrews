My work focuses on closely examining the self and its relationship with technology, collecting and archiving [digital memorabilia]("https://www.are.na/samantha-andrews/screenshots-rom_k7kfyby"), and encouraging myself and others to slow down and make art.

I am compelled by the ways in which we use design and technology to write poetry, deepen our capacity for empathy, and strengthen local communities.

I see life as a practice. I'm currently practicing keeping promises to myself, doing [cartwheels](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CKH1fgZFED2/) (badly), and identifying birds. I try not to take myself too seriously.

Previously, I taught computer programming to girls ages 11-18 with [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) and built geospatial web applications with [Descartes Labs](https://www.descarteslabs.com/).

Now, I work as a frontend software engineer at the [New York Public Library](https://www.nypl.org/).
