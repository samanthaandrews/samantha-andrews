## Death to boring websites

The internet is a magical place full of possibility.

So why do I see so many slow, poorly-designed, and dare I say, _boring_ websites?!

I specialize in building fun and interesting websites and web apps that make users say, **_"Wow! I've never seen anything like this before!"_**

> I want you to feel confident that your online presence matches the effervescence of your brand, your personality, and your offering.

### Who are you?

- An **artist** or _designer_ who wants a bespoke portfolio site that's so much more than a gallery of static images.
- A **nonprofit** looking to expand your outreach with a single-page web app that takes users on an educational journey.
- A **creative business owner** ready to level-up your marketing game with a share-worthy micro site that will generate buzz for your offering.
- A **startup** that needs a brand-spankin'-new website. You're excited by the possibility of using a modern JavaScript solution instead of Wordpress or SquareSpace.

  <blockquote>
    Are you dreaming up the magical possibilities for your online presence right now? A custom online quiz reminiscent of the ones from Seventeen magazine? A custom Instagram filter? A button that spits glitter? Something totally weird and wacky that you've never seen anyone do on the internet before?!

### Why hire me to build your website?

- In addition to making your website reflect your brand's personality, I'll also ensure that it is **accessible**, **fast**, and **SEO-optimized**.
- I’m a designer who codes! Which means you don’t have to hire two separate people to execute your vision.
- I'm a good communicator, reliable, autonomous, pragmatic and happy to project manage myself and/or a wider team.
- I use a modern JavaScript tech stack for my projects which allows me to build blazing-fast websites and apps that are 100% customizable. For most static websites, I use Gatsby or Next.js. For other projects, I use React or Vue.
- I want to partner with you on your JavaScript project for the long term. From design and planning, through to development, launch, and further improvements.

## Hey there!

<img class="curve__image" alt="samantha andrews headshot" src="https://samantha-andrews.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/home/circle_headshot.png"/>

I’ve been designing and building websites for the past 5 years and I’m here to make yours stand out!

My recipe for kick-ass websites is actually quite simple: **clear and consistent messaging**, **fun and user-friendly design**, and **lightweight, super fast code**.

### Some fun facts about me

- I pride myself in being organized and a little obsessive about my streamlined project management system. I know how important it is to feel like your web developer is taking care of all the technical details.
- My superpowers are creative expression, collaboration, and curiosity.
- One time I shaved my head at a truck stop during a road trip up the West Coast.
- My obsession with design started with making zines in 2014. I also played guitar in an all-ladies punk band ⍤
