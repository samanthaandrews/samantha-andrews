## Death to boring websites

The internet is a magical place full of possibility.

So why do I see so many slow, poorly-designed, and dare I say, _boring_ websites?!

I specialize in building fun and interesting websites and web apps that make users say, **_"Wow! I've never seen anything like this before!"_**

> I want you to feel confident that your online presence matches the effervescence of your brand, your personality, and your offering.

## Hey there! I'm Samantha ☺︎

I’ve been designing and building websites for the past 5 years and I’m here to make yours stand out!

My recipe for kick-ass websites is actually quite simple: **clear and consistent messaging**, **fun and user-friendly design**, and **lightweight, super-fast code**.

### Some fun facts about me

- I pride myself in being organized and a little obsessive about my streamlined project management system. I know how important it is to feel like your web developer is taking care of all the technical details.
- My superpowers are creative expression, collaboration, and curiosity.
- I became interested in design during a college class where I learned all about publishing literary magazines (before that, I told everyone I was going to become a lawyer). Soon after, I started making zines and played guitar in an all-ladies punk band ⍤
- One time I shaved my head at a truck stop during a road trip up the West Coast.
