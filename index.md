I'm a software engineer exploring how AI can make life more streamlined—so I can spend less time on screens and more time present with my family. I'm interested in using the latest tech to create space for what matters: two small kids, a creative practice, and a slower pace of life.

I'm drawn to work that improves how teams function: automating repetitive processes, building better workflows, and creating systems that help people do their best work.

I've spent the past few years at the New York Public Library leading engineering teams, and before that building data visualization tools at Descartes Labs.

## Work

My technical stack: React, TypeScript, Next.js, Capacitor, AI coding tools (Claude, Gemini, GitHub Copilot), automated testing, accessibility-first development.

Recent projects include an automated grocery ordering app, internal AI-powered Slack bot for NYPL, and hybrid mobile e-reading apps serving 100,000+ students.

## Writing & Making

I write about whatever's on my mind: parenting two small kids in Brooklyn, making time for creative work, learning AI engineering, organizing a home, and moving at my own pace.

Beyond software, I maintain a creative practice exploring printmaking, collage, and DIY projects. I document everything on my blog and YouTube.
