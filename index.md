I'm interested in using technology to create space for what matters: a loving family, creative work, and a slower pace of life.

I'm drawn to work that improves how teams function: automating repetitive processes, building better workflows, and creating systems that help people do their best work.

I've spent the past few years at the New York Public Library building accessible e-reading apps and leading engineering teams, and before that designing and building data visualization tools for geospatial data at Descartes Labs.

## Writing & Making

I write about whatever's on my mind: parenting two small kids in Brooklyn, making time for creative work, learning AI engineering, organizing a home, and moving at my own pace.

Beyond software, I maintain a creative practice exploring printmaking, collage, and DIY projects. I document everything on my blog and YouTube.
